Towerino is simple scope tower defender game. Aiming to deliver a full gameplay cycle (start->finish), Towerino was developed as a gamedev challenge where the author had 3 days to create a tower defender based game.
Of course I failed doing it in 3 days because I wanted to create and implement my own visuals. In total, the first iteration of my submission was done in 6 effective days.
